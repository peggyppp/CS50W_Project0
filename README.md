# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project, I prepared 4 html pages to introduce my cats.
There're index.html, disco.html, bobo.html, little_p.html, hyperlinks are contained for each other pages.

In the index.html, I basicly use Bootstrap to design the RWD page with columns.

In the other three html pages, I use stylesheet(styles.css) to do the mobile-responsive @media query, which included many .class and #id selectors.
And this stylesheet is generated with inheritance and nesting features from SCSS file(styles.scss).
For bigger screen, I use tables to present the layout; and for smaller screen, I use Bootstrap container again.
In the content of html, img and lists are also inclued.
